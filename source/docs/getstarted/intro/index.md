## Intro

**Barba.js** — aka *Barba* —  is a small *(7kb minified and compressed)* and easy-to-use library that helps you create fluid and smooth transitions between your website's pages. It makes your website run like a **SPA** *(Single Page Application)* and help reduce the delay between your pages, minimize browser HTTP requests and enhance your user's web experience.

> **Notice**: this guide assumes intermediate knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is worth mentioning that all code examples use ES6+ syntax. If you are not comfortable with this syntax, we would encourage you to grasp the basics then come back.
>
> In case of emergency, check the ["legacy" code example](/docs/getstarted/legacy/).
