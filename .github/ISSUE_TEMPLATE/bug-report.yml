      By opening an issue, you consider that there is a problem with the library itself, rather than your code. If you are requesting for help, please **use the Slack workspace** in order to ask the whole community. Join using the invite link, read [the developer documentation](https://barba.js.org/docs/getstarted/useful-links/#Developer). Alternatively, I can provide a custom code support for you or your company through [sponsoring/quote](https://github.com/sponsors/xavierfoucrier) depending on the amount of work, don't hesitate to reach me by mail or private message on Slack ‚úåÔ∏èü™¥.
